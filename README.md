# LeetCode Doodles

## About
Various solutions and exercises for leetcode interview prep problems<br>

#### Methodology and Mindset
- Don't invest too much or too little in each problem
- Always dial back to easy problems to build confidence and momentum
- Use pen/paper first, paint a naive solution and advance in the best plausible direction
- Develop both methodical and technical aspects: don't leave the code minimal or dirty
- Don't overthink, just start
- When learning a new language, go over some easy/familiar problems
