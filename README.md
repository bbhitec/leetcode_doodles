# LeetCode Doodles

## About
Various solutions and exercises for leetcode interview prep problems<br>

#### Methodology and Mindset
- Don't invest too much or too little in each problem
- Always dial back to easy problems to build confidence and momentum
- Use pen/paper first, paint a naive solution and advance in the best plausible direction
- Develop both methodical and technical aspects: don't leave the code minimal or dirty
- Don't overthink, just start


## WIP
[ ] normalize documentation/comments/structure
[ ] filter miscompleted apps
[ ] cpp: use of makefiles and dynamic/static includes
<br><br>

## Gains
- Methodical: Algirithms implementation, Problem solving
- Technical: Best practices and familiarity towards the used languages: Python, Cpp
### Other Gains
- Documentation
- Code running time measurement
